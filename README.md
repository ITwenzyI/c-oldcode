# 🧠 First Semester C Programming Exercises
This repository contains a collection of small C programs and exercises I wrote during my first semester of studying Medical Informatics.

## 📂 About
These programs were created for practice and coursework during my introductory programming course. They cover basic C concepts such as:

- Input/output
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions
- Arrays and pointers

The code is not optimized or polished, but kept for documentation and learning purposes.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
These are old student projects and may contain beginner mistakes.
Feel free to use the code as reference or inspiration, but not for serious applications.
