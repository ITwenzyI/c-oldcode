# Matrix Multiplication in C

A simple C program that performs matrix multiplication and prints the resulting matrix.

## 💡 Description

This project demonstrates:
- Basic array and matrix handling in C
- Use of nested loops for mathematical operations
- Matrix multiplication logic using 2D arrays
- Clean output formatting

The program multiplies two predefined matrices `A` and `B`, stores the result in matrix `C`, and prints it using a helper function.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: C 
- Compiler: `gcc`

## 📊 Example Output

Result from Matrix multiplication:
58.00 64.00 
139.00 154.00
